Power Solution for Four 12V Motors: Each motor draws 4A continuously, so total current draw from motors: 4 × 4A = 16A.
Power Solution for a Camera: The camera draws 0.5A at 12V.

Total Current Draw: 
Motors = 16A and Camera = 0.5A, so total = 16.5A.

Operating Time:
The system must operate for at least half an hour (0.5 hours).

Battery Voltage:
12V (to match the system voltage).

Calculations:
Total Energy Required: Energy (in watt-hours) = Voltage (V) × Current (A) × Time (hours).
Required energy = 12V × 16.5A × 0.5 hours = 99 Wh.

Battery Selection Criteria:
Capacity: The battery must have a capacity of at least 99Wh.
Minimize Weight, Size, and Cost: Choose a battery that offers the necessary capacity with the smallest size and weight at an affordable price.
Factor of Safety: It's prudent to add a margin to ensure reliability, for example, a 20% factor of safety, so adjusted capacity = 99 Wh × 1.2 = 118.8 Wh.

The most suitable battery:
